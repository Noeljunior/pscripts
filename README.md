## pscripts
My personal scripts repo.

This is in a messy state [and it will stay like that for a while, probably].

You may find some very small alias or some complete things. For example, there is a wineapps scripts that is kind off a prefix manager: it allows you to have a lot of different prefixes and run specific apps from each prefix or run a command as in that prefix in a easier way. You may also find some workarounds for the Arch Linux.

#### Notice
Each script deppends on a lot of packages. You will need to check by yourself what are the deps.
